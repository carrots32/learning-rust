# learning-rust
Currently teaching myself Rust.
This is mostly just me, stepping through the tutorials.
The ch number indicates what chapter of https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ the main code comes from.

Note that some code examples are included in the tutorials that intentionally cause compile errors/warnings. In this case I have generally either left them out if they are what I deem to be a standard behaviour; or if it is something that is particularly Rust-specific or unusual behaviour to be noted, I have added the appropriate example as a comment.

I have also included some things I found useful that was not included in the coding section of tutorials, like various declarations of data types and such.
